Getting Started
+++++++++++++++++

Hi there! Welcome to the beginning of your journey with trendPy. Before you start to learn how to use the
TrendPy package you must install it on your desktop environment. 


Install via pip
========================================

TrendPy can be installed using the ``pip install trendpy2`` command.


Local usage without installation
=========================================================

You can just download the trendpy2 package from  `github project page <https://github.com/zolabar/trendPy>`_ and copy paste it into
your working directory.


Cool! You have installed the package on your desktop now.
To verify this you can open or create a python script and import the package with ``import trendpy2``. If no error appears 
the package was installed successfully and you can go ahead by reading the documentation or just running the example.ipynb, found on
`github project page <https://github.com/zolabar/trendPy>`_ .
The module section contains some simple doc string examples, too. However, it is recommended to have look at the example.ipynb in order
to get started smoothly ;) 

Web Apps
========

If you just want to try out the trendPy package, you can also do that in your browser. That way you wont have to install anything.

#. Use the streamlit app, button on  `github project page <https://github.com/zolabar/trendPy>`_ 
#. Or use the voila app, button on  `github project page <https://github.com/zolabar/trendPy>`_  
#. Now you can play around with the x and y variables and pick your trend line.
#. Once you are finished, you can save the created plot as a png via the small photo button to the right of the plot.
#. Congratulations, now you have a nice trend line of your choosing for your data. It's really that simple.
